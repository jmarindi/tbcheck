Publicly available Machine Learning model for checking for presence of Tuberculosis in an X-rays 
# 🩻 TB X-Ray Diagnostic Ensemble System

This is a lightweight, web-based medical imaging application designed to screen chest X-rays for Tuberculosis (TB). The system utilizes an **Ensemble Learning** approach, combining predictions from three distinct deep learning architectures to improve diagnostic reliability.

## Live Demo

## 🧠 Model Architectures
The system runs a simultaneous analysis across three models trained on chest X-ray datasets:
1. **Custom CNN:** A lightweight convolutional neural network optimized for specific feature extraction.
2. **MobileNetV2:** A highly efficient architecture utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, ideal for web deployment.
3. **ResNet50:** A deep residual network that uses skip connections to identify complex patterns in lung tissue.
